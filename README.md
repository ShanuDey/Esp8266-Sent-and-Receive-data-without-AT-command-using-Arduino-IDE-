# Esp8266-Sent-and-Receive-data-without-AT-command-using-Arduino-IDE-
Hi , I am Shanu.
This code is completely written on C/C++ language.

For using this code : 
  Just download the zip or clone it.
  Open the ino file in arduino ide or whatever you want.
  Then you must change the "ssid", "password", "host".
  (optional) You may change the input output pin as your project required.
  Now upload the code to your device like esp8266 or nodemcu whatever you are using.

For any query or suggestion or issue just make me inform.
Thank you.
